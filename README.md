## Challenge

Take Home Challenge:

You are given a list of words sorted in alphabetical order. The only issue is that this alphabet isn’t English. Can you determine the ordering of the alphabet?

Note that you can assume the list of words will have enough information to derive the complete order of the alphabet.

Input:

‘bca’

‘aaa’

‘acb’

Output:

	[‘b’, ‘a’, ‘c’]
